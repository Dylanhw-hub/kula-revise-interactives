    html: `<div class="sp-body">King's earliest exposure to the ideas that would coalesce (blend) in his non-violent philosophy occurred when he was an undergraduate at Morehouse College. It was not until he began to study the life and works of Mahatma Gandhi that he began to see the possibility of applying non-violence to the specific problems of African Americans, especially in the South. As he later told it, in Philadelphia he listened to a sermon by the president of Howard University, Mordecai Johnson, who spoke at length about the teachings and actions of Gandhi, and in particular his use of non-violent mass protest to challenge British control over India.<br><br>For King, the heart of Gandhi's non-violence was love, in the spiritual, transcendent (divine) form of the word. In the face of coercive (intimidating), racist British rule, Gandhi so loved his oppressors that he refused to take up arms against them.<br><br>What did King mean by non-violence? It was not merely the refusal to hit back, an insistence on turning the other cheek. It was, in its own way, aggressive. It meant putting oneself in the face of violence, of actively confronting it and responding with love to the jabs and punches.<br><br>It also meant organising thousands across the South in specific mass actions that would force face-to-face encounters with white, racist power. Doing so, King thought, would demonstrate both the impotence (weakness) of white violence and show the country that the black community was not afraid to insist on its rights.</div>`,

    html: `<div class="sp-body">I think we have come to the point where there is no longer a choice now between non-violence and riots. It must be militant, massive non-violence, or riots. The discontent is so deep, the anger so ingrained (deep-rooted), the despair, the restlessness so wide, that something has to be brought into being to serve as a channel through which these deep angry feelings can be funnelled (directed).<br><br>Even if I didn't deal with the moral dimensions and question of violence versus non-violence, from a practical point of view, I don't see riots working. But I am convinced that if rioting continues, it will strengthen the right wing of the country and we'll end up with a kind of right-wing takeover in the cities and a Fascist development, which will be terribly injurious (harmful) to the whole nation.<br><br>I am committed to non-violence absolutely. I'm just not going to kill anybody, whether it's in Vietnam or here. I'm not going to burn down any building. If non-violent protest fails this summer, I will continue to preach it and teach it, and we at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference will still do this. I plan to stand by non-violence because I have found it to be a philosophy of life that regulates my dealings in the struggle for racial justice. I will be faithful to non-violence.</div>`,

It makes them believe that Negroes are meek (submissive), supine (passive) creatures.<br><br><strong>KING:</strong> Well, I don't think that's true. If anyone has ever lived with a non-violent movement in the South, from Montgomery on through the Freedom Rides and through the sit-in movement and the recent Birmingham movement, and seen the reactions of many of the extremists and reactionaries in the white community, he wouldn't say that this movement makes them comfortable. I think it arouses a sense of shame within them often. I think it does something to touch the conscience and establish a sense of guilt.<br><br><strong>CLARK:</strong> James Baldwin raises the question of whether it will be possible to contain the Negro people within this framework of non-violence if we continue to have more of the kinds of demonstrations that we had in Birmingham, wherein the police brought dogs to attack human beings. What is your reaction to Mr Baldwin's anxiety?<br><br><strong>KING:</strong> &hellip; we can be sure that the vast majority of Negroes who engage in the demonstrations and who understand the non-violent philosophy will be able to face dogs and all of the other brutal methods that are used without retaliating with violence.</div>`,

A definition that could apply to anything is too vague.'], ['Connect to the historical context', 'when the question says "in the context of." Link to the specific period, event, or situation.']],
