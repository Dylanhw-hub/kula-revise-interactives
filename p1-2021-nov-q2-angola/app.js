    html: `<div class="sp-body">In April 1974, junior officers belonging to the Movement of the Armed Forces (MFA) toppled the Salazar-Caetano regime in Portugal and began the process of decolonisation.<br><br>In 1974, however, a frenzy (rage) of diplomatic and political activity at home (Angola) and abroad mitigated (helped) against a negotiated independence. In 1975, as the will to retain imperial control over Angola dwindled (declined), fighting broke out in many provinces of Angola and also in the capital, Luanda, where the armies of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) were intended to maintain the peace with joint patrols. In January 1975, under heavy international pressure, the colonial power and the three movements had signed an agreement in Alvor, Portugal, providing for a transitional (temporary) government, a constitution, elections and independence.<br><br>This Alvor Accord soon collapsed, however, and the transitional government scarcely (hardly) functioned. In the subsequent confrontations the FNLA received military support from Zaire with the backing of China and the US, while under Agostinho Neto the MPLA gained ground, in particular in Luanda, with support from the Soviet Union and from Cuban troops. On 11 November 1975 Angola became independent. The FNLA and UNITA were excluded from the city and from government and a socialist one-party regime was established which eventually gained international recognition, though not from the United States.</div>`,

    html: `<div class="sp-body">The Soviet Union and Cuba doubled down (increased) on their defence of the MPLA government. The Soviets amped (increased) up their economic aid, while the Cubans initially committed about 15 000 ground troops to the region, a number that rose to nearly 36 000 within the year.<br><br>The United States' intervention in Angola was heavily shaped by several factors. First, much like in Vietnam, American leaders, such as Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, believed that a communist takeover in Angola would lead to a domino effect in the rest of southern Africa. If Angola fell, it was feared that the Soviets, Cuba, and to a lesser extent China, would feel bold enough to inspire revolution that was Pan-African and communist in nature &hellip; throughout the African continent.<br><br>Second, offshore of the northern half of the country lay enormous oil fields. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union wanted such reserves to fall into the other's hands. Angolan oil could potentially benefit both nations economically &hellip;<br><br>Third, the CIA feared that the Soviet Union was attempting to establish a military base in Angola. Such a concern was based on historical evidence. The Soviets had backed a 1977 coup led by former Interior Minister of Angola, Nito Alves &hellip; American officials knew that the Angolan Civil War served as a real threat to its interests throughout all of Africa.</div>`,

The public remained acutely sensitive to any suggestion of the spread of communist influence &ndash; broadly defined &ndash; in any part of Africa or the Indian Ocean.<br><br>Pretoria therefore launched a series of exploratory overtures (proposals) to the FNLA and UNITA to see whether an Angola ruled by either would provide the regional stability and security that South Africa desired. From February 1975, SADF military intelligence and the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) officials began meeting regularly with the upper echelons (ranks) of both organisations in Angola and Europe.<br><br>Both the FNLA and UNITA were desperate for help and said what South Africa wanted to hear: namely that an Angola under their control would form part of an anti-communist bloc in southern Africa &hellip; Crucially, both committed to denying SWAPO bases from which to operate in southern Angola &hellip; Consequently, over the coming months Pretoria supplied limited military aid and funding to both organisations.</div>`,

A definition that could apply to anything is too vague.'], ['Connect to the historical context', 'when the question says "in the context of." Link to the specific period, event, or situation.']],

That doesn\'t make it unreliable, but a historian needs to be aware of it.']],
